# WG_Leads_meeting_action_items

This repo is solely for the purpose of adding WG Leads Meeting action items to a project board and tracking them. The issues I add for this board may not be as crisp as a typical software development issue (e.g., more like someone work with someone on something). Would be great to quickly review this board at the WG Leads meetings.
